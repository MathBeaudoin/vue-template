# Hi! Salut! Hallo!

This is a very basic template to kickstart any Vue 3 application I would be tempted to make :)

It includes mainly all the dependencies and folder structure for:

- **Testing**
- **SPA metadata support**
- **i18n**
- **Logging**
- **SEO files generation**
- **npm commands** (build, format, test, etc.)

And many more!
Have fun.
